The objective of this experiment is to observe how the system performance changes when we accumulate training data with languages belonging to same script family For example, Hindi, Sanskrit, Marathi, etc. belong to same family. The hypothesis here is that grouping languages with similar script will significantly increase the training data and if the above hypothesis (Experiment 1) is true, then this should increase the system performance.
