The objective of this experiment is to observe the changes in system performance when we try compositional transliteration. Given the source language script X and target script Z, I want to observe the system performance when an intermediate language is chosen in the process. That is, X -> Y -> Z. The hypothesis here is that the error will accumulate over the two conversions and the system performance should decrease drastically.
